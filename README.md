# Breast-Cancer-Infiltrate
This personal project seeks to explore RNA seq data from TCGA. Specifically, the RNA seq data from the TCGA-BRCA project. This cohort is comprised of 1,231 unique tissue samples sequenced using the Illumina platform. 

With this data, I seek to answer the following questions:
* What major immune cell types infiltrate breast tumors?
* What genes are most expressed in breast tumor? 

The answer to these questions could help guide future therapies by educating new therapies, providing insights towards potential immune and cancer targets.
